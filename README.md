# miniproject
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease risk based on lifestyle and health factors like age, BMI, smoking, alcohol use, diet, exercise, and conditions such as diabetes or cancer. After preprocessing and balancing the data using SMOTE, several models were trained and combined into an ensemble meta-model.
